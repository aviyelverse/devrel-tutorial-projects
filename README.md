- Node.js is a popular server-side framework that allows us to run JavaScript code on a web server.

- Express is a Node.js web application framework that makes Node application development simpler and faster.

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data persistently in the form of collections and documents.

- React is a JavaScript frontend library for creating user interfaces.
